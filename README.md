## Problem 5: Homework statistics

Please let us know how much time you spent on each problem. You may enter time using any format described [here](https://github.com/wroberts/pytimeparse).

Problem 1: 1 hour

This one wasn't so bad once I figured out the format of primitives. I had a bit of trouble figuring out how to format the error specifically, but once I did it was smooth sailing.

Problem 2: 4 hours 20 minutes

This problem gave me a lot of trouble just because I wasn't sure if it should be a special form or not. I had spent some attempts on implementing the function using (eval-definition) before finally deciding to switch to a special form. Once I had figured out 'and,' 'or' ended up being a pretty easy variation.

Problem 3: 2 hours

This problem was also very tough, mostly with figuring out how to plug the values into the given procedure. A TA pointed me in the direction of the function (extend-environment), which gave me pretty much everything I was looking for. The functions for parsing the data came from the example let function in the Metacircular Evaluator notes.

Problem 4: 1 hour

I also found this problem to be pretty tough, and in the end, I wasn't able to get one of the tests to work. I really wish there were more documentation or examples on how to use force-delay, the ones in the lecture were pretty confusing. Hopefully I had the right approach in the code, but there's surely a better way that would involve getting all tests right.
